This Makefile system was created by Martin Oldfield <ex-atelier@mjo.tc> and the license is his also.  I have placed one simple makefile in here also.  It will not work since there are no source files in this directory.  His blog post discussing use is located [here](http://mjo.tc/atelier/2009/02/arduino-cli.html).
